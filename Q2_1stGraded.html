        <h2>Ajisaki | Japanese Cusine </h2>
            <p><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: relatively cheap, good food</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (~20 mins sometimes)</ol>
            <p>Ajisaki is a classic for many pisay students: it's fast, delicious, and relatively cheap.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal recommendations:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Tonkatsu (100 takeout, 90 dine in) - fried pork w/ japanese-style sauce (can add on colesaw and mayo for free)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gyoza (25 EACH PIECE takeout and dine in) - pork and vegtable dumplings with soy sauce (can add chili oil for 15)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Katsu Curry (105 takeout, 95 dine in) - fried pork w/ curry sauce carrots and potatoes (can add on colesaw and mayo for free)
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <h2>Colais | Filipino Cusine</h2>
            <p><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: relatively cheap, good food, healthier options, more options in general</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (most teachers buy here as well, so ~10-15 mins)</ol>
            <p>Colais offers far more options than Ajisaki, which is why when I've had enough of Aji I usually just swap over to Colais,</p>
            <p>as their menu changes depending on the day, leaving with me with not just more, but healthier choices. They also have really</p>
            <p>good shakes for cheap with a lot of decent options.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal recommendations:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Dinuguan w/ rice (95 takeout, 85 dine in)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pork Siniggang w/ rice (95 takeout, 85 dine in)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sourcream Fried Chicken w/ rice (100 takeout, 90 dine in)
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <h2>Yummy Tummy | Snacks/Rice Meals</h2>
            <p><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: large selection of snacks, average prices (mostly)</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (~10 mins worst), lowk unhealthy</ol>
            <p>Yummy Tummy is a recent addition this year, but it has gotten very popular. Most of their menu consists of snacks,</p>
            <p>with a few rice meals and sandwhiches. They also have really good ice cream and juices, so great for cooling down as well.</p>  
            <p>The only issue I have with it though, is that its quite unhealthy to eat those things everyday.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal recommendations:</strong></p>   
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Hungarian Sausage ()
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Strawberry Ice Cream (40?)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        insert one more here
                    </li>
                </ol>

        <h2>Redstraw Cafe | Pizza, Waffles, Milkshakes</h2>
        <p><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: pretty dang solid food</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (long cooking time, ~20-30mins during peak hours), lowk expensive, lowk unhealthy</ol>
            <p>Like Yummy Tummy, redstraw is also new this year. However, it quickly became popular due to the pretty good food.</p>
            <p>However, due to the preparation time in addition to its popularity, the waiting time can be really long. Its also kind of expensive, </p>
            <p>and also kind of unhealthy (waffles, pizza).</p>
            <p><strong>Personal recommendations:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Beef Pizza + Mushrooms ()
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nutella w/ Banana Waffle ()
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Curly Fries (75 | only buy if you're feeling magastos...)
                    </li>
