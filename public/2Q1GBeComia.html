        <h2>Ajisaki | Japanese Cusine : 9/10  ìêêìé© .‚ãÜÔæü </h2>
        <p><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: relatively cheap, good food</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (~20 mins at peak hours)</ol>
            <p>Ajisaki is a classic for many pisay students: it's fast, delicious, and relatively cheap. They do have a lot of options, 
                though most of them are fried foods. That being said, unlike the other three stands, Aji's options remain the same always all days,
                meaning at some point (after 3 years), you will get bored of the choices at some point.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal recommendations:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Tonkatsu (PHP 100 takeout, 90 dine in) - fried pork w/ japanese-style sauce (can add on colesaw and mayo for free)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gyoza (PHP 25 EACH PIECE takeout and dine in) - pork and vegtable dumplings with soy sauce (can add chili oil for 15)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Katsu Curry (PHP 105 takeout, 95 dine in) - fried pork w/ curry sauce carrots and potatoes (can add on colesaw and mayo for free)

        <h2 style="margin-left: 30px">Colais | Filipino Cusine : 10/10  ìé© ‚Äß‚ÇäÀö ‚ãÖ</h2>
            <p class="margin1"><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: relatively cheap, good food, healthier options, more options in general</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (most teachers buy here as well, so ~10-15 mins)</ol>
            <p class="margin1">Colais offers far more options than Ajisaki, which is why when I've had enough of Aji I usually just swap over to Colais, 
                as their menu changes depending on the day, leaving with me with not just more, but healthier choices. 
                They also have really good fruit shakes for cheap with a lot of decent options.</p>
            <p class="margin1"><strong>Personal recommendations:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>

        <h2>Yummy Tummy | Snacks/Rice Meals : 7/10 ìåâ‚óØìáã </h2>
            <p><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: large selection of snacks, average prices (mostly)</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (~10 mins worst), lowk unhealthy</ol>
            <p>Yummy Tummy is a recent addition this year, but it has gotten very popular. Most of their menu consists of snacks, with a few rice meals and sandwhiches. 
                They also have really good ice cream and juices, so great for cooling down as well. The only issue I have with it though, 
                is that its quite unhealthy to eat those things everyday.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal recommendations:</strong></p>   
                <ol>
                    <li>

        <p class="margin1"><strong>Pros & Cons</strong></p>
                <ol>Pros: pretty dang solid food</ol>
                <ol>Cons: long waiting time due to popularity (long cooking time, ~20-30mins during peak hours), lowk expensive, lowk unhealthy</ol>
            <p class="margin1">Like Yummy Tummy, Redstraw is also new this year. However, it quickly became popular due to the pretty good food. However, due to the preparation time in addition to its popularity, 
                the waiting time can be really long. Its also kind of expensive and also kind of unhealthy (waffles, pizza).</p>
